The project uses EyelevelAI's state of the art document parsing and retrieval system GroundX. It's integrated as a custom tool with CrewAI.

GroundX can also be deployed completely on premise as well, the code is open-source, here's their [GitHub repo](https://github.com/eyelevelai/groundx-on-prem).
